								<h2>Degree</h2>
								<h3> </h3>
								<h4>2007-present</h4>
								<p>Studying for a Computer Science degree at Sussex University gaining development skills.  Amongst others, I have taken courses in Java programming, web services, algorithms, software engineering, and compilers.  I expect to 									graduate with an upper second-class honours degree.  <br><br>For my final year project, I am developing a location aware app for the Android operating system.  The aim is to provide a portal for mountain bikers who use the Friston Forest, showing maps of the forest trails, integrating media such as videos and photos and an augmented reality view, using location providers to keep a fix on the users current location and providing route finding functionality. During my project thus far, I have learned new technologies in a short space of time such as the Android SDK, XML and distributed source code control, as well as developed my skills in Java and software engineering. <br><Br>
As part of my project, I am integrating some third party APIs which has given me an opportunity to work with code developed by other people and has provided an interesting and valuable learning experience.  I am aiming to show the whole software development lifecycle from gathering user requirements, through high and low level design documentation with UML, through coding to testing with JUnit and user acceptance testing.

I provide cover for our front desk staff, taking phone calls from faculty and students, logging issues in our call-logging package and routing problems to the correct team.   I also perform password resets and other account 				administration tasks and check print queues, giving refunds where appropriate. <br><Br>								
Along with the necessary diverse technical skills, the role requires excellent communication skills, the ability to 								take ownership of problems and see them through to a satisfactory resolution, and the ability to work well as part 								of a close team.
